## Properties Panels
![DAG: Properties Panels](/doc/images/dag.properties_panels.gif)

I work with floating properties panels. I find it really annoying dealing with the Properties pane. Managing which ones are open and in what order is a pain.

Floating panes are great because I can position them however I want for what I'm doing. One thing that's a pain with this is managing the opening and closing of the properties panels however.

To solve this, I do a couple things:
1). No properties panels open on node creation.
2). `a` opens the properties panels of the selected node(s).
3). `alt+a` closes all properties panels.
