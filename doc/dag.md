## Properties Panels
![DAG: Properties Panels](/doc/images/dag.properties_panels.gif)


I work with floating properties panels. I find it really annoying dealing with the Properties pane. Managing which ones are open and in what order is a pain.

Floating panes are great because I can position them however I want for what I'm doing. One thing that's a pain with this is managing the opening and closing of the properties panels however.

Modifications to default behavior and **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  1). Disable properties panel open on node creation.
  2). `a`: Open the properties panels of the selected node(s).
  3). `alt+a`: Close all properties panels.
