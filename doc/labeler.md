## Labeler
![Labeler](/doc/images/dag.labeler.gif)
- `shift+a`: Show labeler widget. Note this shortcut overwrites the built-in shortcut for AddMix.

This is a simple utility to modify the label knob of one or more nodes. I often use labels in my comp scripts to leave nodes for myself about what the hell I was thinking. This allows me to do that more efficiently.
