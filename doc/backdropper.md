Backdropper is a utility for creating and modifying backdrop nodes.

If it is invoked with nodes selected, a backdrop node is created that is sized to fit the selection. 

The Backdropper tool allows you to edit the text in a backdrop node. It automatically inserts some html into the label so that the first line is a header, the second line is a subheader, and the rest are body text, each with a smaller size. 

It allows you to adjust the hue, saturation, and value of the backdrop color, the size and brightness of the text, as well as the style of the backdrop node.

If the last selected node is a backdrop, that backdrop node is opened for editing.
